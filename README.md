# TestDriveApp

**QA Project By Ismet Arifi**

This application is a backend-only project that allows for booking test drives by customers of a luxury showroom. Moreover, this application is based on booking luxury cars for test driving. For both a customer and a booking table in the database, it offers complete CRUD capabilities. It would be simpler to track and keep test drive reservations using this application for every specific showroom. This readME file gives a thorough description of the functionality of the programme, as well as testing results, instructions for using the app, and future plans to enhance the source code and the app as a whole.
This project was tracked through a sprint on Jira.

3. Further to that install MySQL and update all the database credentials located within the application properties.
5. Run the project utilising your chosen IDE.
6. Send all relevant CRUD requests to the API utilising an API client, most suitably ‘Postman’ or for those among you working on Mac, give ‘Paw’ a try as its beautiful interface is really pleasant to interact with.
7. Sit back and enjoy.

**Future Improvements**

I intend to continue populating my database in the near future so that it is accurate. In order to make it look good and attractive, I also intend to create a front end. Please be patient while I update this project and get it up to my desired standard.
